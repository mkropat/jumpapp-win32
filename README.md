# jumpapp-win32

*Jump to another application. Always. **Windows Version***

**JumpApp** focuses the window of the application you're interested in —
assuming it's already running — otherwise **JumpApp** launches the application
for you.

It the application is running and one of its windows is already focused,
**JumpApp** will switch to the application's next window, if there is more than
one. Running **JumpApp** multiple times for a given hotkey will cycle you
through all of the application's windows.
